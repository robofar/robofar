- 👋 Hi, I’m @robofar
- 👀 I’m interested in SLAM and Computer Vision for Robotics
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on:
  - revising and improving my skills in C++
  - classical and neural SLAM
  - CUDA C++
  - Deep Learning
  - TODO: Read more about ViTs, VGGTs and their usages in SLAM, 3D Reconstruction and World Models
- 📫 You can reach me by sending an email to `robofar123@gmail.com`.
- 🌳 I love nature, mountains and hiking.
